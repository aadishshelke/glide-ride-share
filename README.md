Hey there, this is my official repository for the submission of the take-home assignment for the frontend web development intern role at FischerJordan.

About myself :
I'm a BTech CSE student at IIIT Pune, currently pursuing an Honors in Machine Learning. With a strong foundation in AI, web development, and software engineering, I love building scalable applications, researching on core ML topics, and solving complex problems through code.

What I Do:
Machine Learning & Research: Research work in deep learning for medical diagnostics.
Full-Stack Development: Built and deployed applications using Next.js, React, Flask, TailwindCSS,etc.
Competitive Programming: Solved 500+ problems across platforms like Codeforces, Leetcode, and CodeChef.
Hackathons & Innovation: Runner-Up at Citi India Hackathon 2024, developing an AI-driven financial platform.
Leadership & Management: Head of Marketing (E-Cell) & Overall Coordinator of Sports Club, IIIT Pune.

About the assignment : 
I mainly focused my implementation on the following functionalities :
1. User Authentication: Used Clerk for authentication, enabling  user registration, login, and profile management and also integrated Clerk’s pre-built UI components since I had prior experisnce with Clerk.
2. Ride Booking: Designed a ride booking system where users can set pickup and destination locations. Integrated Google Maps API for route visualization and enabled users to select ride types while dynamically displaying estimated fares. Also included an option for users to set their current location as the pickup point using the Geolocation API for better convenience.
3. Profile Management: Enabled users to manage their profiles, update personal details, and customize their information.
4. Payment Integration: Integrated Stripe’s API (test mode) to implement a secure checkout system to facilitate ride payments.
5. Notification System: Implemented a notification system using react-toastify to provide updates on ride status, payment confirmations, and profile changes.
6. Responsive: Also added mobile responsive capabilities

Overall It was an amazing learning experience and was extremely insightful for me as a developer. Eagerly looking forward for more opportunities to grow and contribute. Thank you.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
